<h4>Dear khushi,

    I hope this letter finds you well, although I know my recent actions have likely caused you distress and frustration. I am writing to express my deepest apologies for my bad behavior. I want you to know that I am truly sorry for my behavior. I understand that my actions were hurtful and disrespectful, and I deeply regret the pain they caused you. I take full responsibility for my words and actions, and I want to assure you that they are not a reflection of my true feelings for you.
    
    You mean everything to me, and it pains me to see you upset because of something I did. I value our relationship immensely, and I am committed to making things right between us. I promise to learn from this experience and work on improving myself to be a better partner for you.
    
    I understand that trust and communication are vital in any relationship, and I am dedicated to rebuilding any trust that may have been broken because of my actions. Please know that I am here to listen to your thoughts and feelings, and I am willing to do whatever it takes to make amends and regain your trust.
    
    I know that words alone cannot undo the hurt I have caused, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I love you deeply, and I am determined to do everything in my power to make things right between us.
    
    Once again, I am truly sorry for my behavior, and I hope we can work through this together. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to make amends and show you how much you mean to me.
    
    With all my love and sincerity,
    
    aayush </h4>
